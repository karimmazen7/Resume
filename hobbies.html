    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I have followed football ever since I was young, I used to play for 3 years in an Egyptian team as a 
        winger.
        <br> Reading has always been a hobby of mine, I enjoy authors such as Peter James, Charles 
        Dickens, and Michael Morpurgo.
        <br> I believe that you can learn a lot from books, and it is an effective way
        to relax.</p>
